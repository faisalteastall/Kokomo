                            <p>Kokomo brand initially started out as a dream for me. I have always loved the holidays on the beach and the feeling of waking up in the morning with the sun glistening through the windows. I was always disappointed in the limited supply of beautiful resort wear at reasonable prices. I decided to create a new fashion lifestyle concept focused on kaftans, tunics, cover ups, dresses, and trousers in high quality fabrics for the perfect day. The designs are contemporary with handmade details, prints and/or embroidery inspired by the Indian culture.</p>
                            <p>Kokomo is inspired by travel, nature and culture. The kokomo garments are about the feel, it should feel like a second skin to you.</p>
                            <p>Kokomo is a way of life.</p>
